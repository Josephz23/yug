					Since I was a child I felt an extraordinary curiosity for new experiences, this incentivized me to seek participation in the programs that the school had like workshops, scholarships, or participation in scholar events. For two years I attended computer classes at UEES, starting my foundations in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.<br><br>

					I held positions as team leader on several occasions, although I must say that applying pressure on the members never seemed comfortable to me even if it was necessary, so I preferred to be a follower, but only of a good leader. However, on the occasions that the position of leader was assigned to me, I fulfilled it with all possible effort I was able to do.<br><br>

					For a time between 4th grade and 7th grade I convinced myself of having a low profile, I think it was due to a rebellious stage but it was a time of bad scores and bad behaviors. It was in 8th grade, the year 2018, that a great opportunity was presented, I had the chance to join to  ¡Supérate! , a 3-year scholarship where English, computing, and values are taught, without a doubt one of the best decisions of my life.<br><br>
